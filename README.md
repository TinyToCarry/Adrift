Overview
Adrift is a 2D atmospheric platformer game prototype, heavily inspired by the minimalist and mysterious aesthetics of Limbo. It was developed as part of the final project for Game Programming 1.

Key Features
Atmospheric Environment: Utilizes Unity’s Universal Render Pipeline (URP) to achieve distance parallaxing in a 2D game rendered within a 3D space.
Dynamic Lighting and Particles: Carefully crafted lighting and particle effects enhance the game's atmosphere and player immersion.
Procedural Animation Experiments: First-time implementation of inverse kinematics for character movements, offering a unique albeit experimental approach to animation.
Physics-Driven Object Interaction: Stiff spring joints simulate object grabbing and pulling, maintaining natural physics-based object behavior.
Development Insights
This project represents a significant step in our learning journey as developers, artists, and programmers:

First Unity URP Project: Leveraging 3D space to enhance parallax effects for a visually compelling 2D experience.
Deep Exploration of Unity Systems: Intensive exploration of Unity's Particle and Lighting systems to create atmospheric depth.
Procedural Animation Learning: Experimentation with procedural techniques allowed us to explore innovative methods beyond traditional sprite-based animations.
Physics-Based Solutions: Custom workarounds for object interaction enabled natural physics responses while maintaining control and gameplay integrity.

Learning Experience
This project marked a pivotal exploration of Unity's full potential in game design. Having self-taught programming for a previous group project without formal Unity training, this prototype was a practical laboratory for discovering and integrating Unity’s functionalities, including lighting, particle systems, and procedural animation techniques. The focus was not just on creating a game but on gaining hands-on experience and overcoming technical challenges to further personal growth and understanding of game development principles.

Feel free to modify or use the code.
The game can be played after downloading the project file and building it in Unity.
